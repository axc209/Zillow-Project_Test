# Machine Learning with Zillow Data

TODO: explain what this code does.

## Development
If you're running this code for the first time, follow these steps:
1. Use a Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`  
     * *Before running step 2, make sure your terminal is using the virtual environment. Visual Studio Code may select it for you automatically, but if that doesn't happen, see the [Python venv docs](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) for instructions on activating the virtual environment.*
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now, you should be using the Python virtual environment (venv) with only the necessary packages installed in the venv.
